                exact APR (Annual Percentage Rate) that you will be charged if you are approved for a loan. APRs depend
                on multiple factors, including the lender’s requirements and offers, your credit worthiness, your state
                of residence, and the type and term of the loan you request. You will be given the details on the APR,
                loan fees, and other terms by your lender when you are redirected to your loan agreement during the loan
                request process.<br><br>
                The APR on a short term loan can range from 200% to 2,290% depending on how the APR is calculated
                (nominal vs. effective), the duration of the loan, loan fees incurred, late payment fees, non-payment
                fees, loan renewal actions, and other factors. Keep in mind that the APR range is not your finance
                charge and your finance charge will be disclosed later on. See a Representative Example<br><br>
                The APR on online personal loans can reach up to 1,386% depending on the lender’s terms, borrower’s
                residence state, the duration of the loan, loan fees incurred, late payment fees, non-payment fees, loan
                extension plan, and other factors. Some states cap APR and the amounts of charges for online personal

                should consult credit advisor prior to making credit decisions of taking a short term or an online
                personal loan for small dollar amount.</p>
